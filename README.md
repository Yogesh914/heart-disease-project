# ðŸ«€ Heart Disease Detection Project

This project will look into using various different python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes. The data used in this project is originally from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
